### Elastic File System 

File storage service for EC2. Easy to use with a simple interface to allow you to create and configure file systems. Storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically, so the storage is there when you need it. 

Historically, it would have to be pre-provisioned and mounted.
