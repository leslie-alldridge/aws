## EC2

Amazon Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

You only need to pay for the capacity that you actually use, instead of over provisioning with physical hardware.

Helps devs create failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

### EC2 Options

- On demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (windows) or the second (linux) with no commitment
- Reserved: capacity reservation and significant discount. 1 or 3 year terms.
- Spot: bid a price and greater savings depending on the spot price. Flexible start and end times. Similar to stock market bidding.
- Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

## On demand

- low cost and flexibility without any up front payment or long-term commitment.
- apps with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time

## Reserved instances

- steady state or predictable usage
- apps that require reserved capacity
- up front payments and reduced costs. Can be up to 75% off the on-demand price.
- Can change reservations from cpu to memory intensive etc
- Can match your capacity to schedule for month end peaks etc

## Spot instances

- flexible start and end times
- apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices (can do heaps sunday evening with low bid instead of during peak time)
- urgent need for a large amount of computing capacity

## Dedicated Hosts

- regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virutalization
- great for licensing
- puchased on demand for up to 75% off the on-demand price

EC2 Instance Types
F1 - financial analytics
I3 - High speed storage
G3 - Graphics intensive
H1 - high disk throughput
T2 - low cost general purpose
D2 - Dense storage
R4 - Memory Optimized
M5 - General purpose
C5 - Compute
P3 - graphics or general purpose GPUs
X1 - Memory optimized

## What is EBS

Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Placed in an AZ and replicated to protect you from a single point of failure.

EBS Types

- General purpose SSD (GP2)

* general purpose, balances price and performance
* ratio of 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time

- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

* Designed for IO intensive apps such as large relational or NoSQL databases
* Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS as these can go up to 20,000 IOPS

- Throughput optimised HDD (ST1) - cannot be a boot volume or root device volume

* Big data, data warehouses, log processing

- Cold HDD (SC1)

* cannot be a boot volume
* for infrequently accessed workloads this is the lowest cost

- Magnetic (standard)

* Legacy, but can still be used. Ideal for infrequent access and this is the lowest overall storage costs. Also is bootable.

Notes:
If a spot instance is terminated by AWS you will not be charge for a partial hour. However, if you terminate it yourself, you will be charged for the entire hour even if you used it for less.

One subnet = one availability zone

Add tags to every instance

Public key is padlock and private key is the key that unlocks it

Use Putty to connect to EC2 via SSH. Need to use putty key gen to convert the .pem file to .ppk so that we can load it into putty. 

sudo yum update will grab all the latest updates once connected.

Use nano index.html to open a file editor in the terminal window and the file will be named index.html. This is like using touch except you can write to the file.

With security groups you cannot deny anything it's an allowance list instead

If green ticks are missing just remove and re-add the security groups

Notes for security groups: 
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is allowed
- Changes to security groups take effect immediately 
- You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
- Multiple security groups can be attached to EC2 instances
- Security groups are stateful
    - If you create an invound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.
- You cannot block specific IP addresses using security groups, instead use network access control lists.
- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
