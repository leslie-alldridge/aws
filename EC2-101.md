## EC2

Amazon Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

You only need to pay for the capacity that you actually use, instead of over provisioning with physical hardware.

Helps devs create failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

### EC2 Options

- On demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (windows) or the second (linux) with no commitment
- Reserved: capacity reservation and significant discount. 1 or 3 year terms.
- Spot: bid a price and greater savings depending on the spot price. Flexible start and end times. Similar to stock market bidding.
- Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
